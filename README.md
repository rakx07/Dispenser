Welcome to the Voucher Dispensing System built using Laravel, designed for my workplace as part of a project to streamline the distribution of voucher codes via kiosk to students. This system allows students of the school to access their voucher codes after their details have been uploaded and verified.

Key features of the project include:

Student Data Upload: Student information is uploaded into the system from a secure database.
Verification Process: Student details are checked for accuracy before allowing them access to their voucher codes.
Voucher Code Access: Once verified, students can view and claim their voucher codes directly from a kiosk.
This Laravel project is part of the institution's goal to make voucher distribution more efficient and user-friendly for students.
